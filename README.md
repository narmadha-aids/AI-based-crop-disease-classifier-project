# AI-Based Crop Disease Classifier 🌿

This is a simple AI-based agriculture project that classifies crop leaf health based on user input.

## 🔍 How It Works

The Python script asks for:
- Leaf color (green/yellow)
- Number of spots on the leaf
- Leaf texture (smooth/rough)

Then it predicts whether the leaf is *Healthy* or *Diseased*.

## 💻 How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Download or clone this repository.
3. Run the script:

```bash
python crop_disease_classifier.py
